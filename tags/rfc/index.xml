      <description>V2Ray is designed to be a flexible network tool for developers. However, in term of developer friendliness it have suffered a bad reputation as being hard to master both for user and third-party developers.
Here, I would like to propose a new stub transport that is intended to reduce the difficulty for developing a transport for V2Ray, and remove the necessity of commitment for development. Pipe transport use operating systemâ€™s fork and/or unix domain socket capability.</description>
